A GitHub Action to post `clang-tidy` warnings and suggestions as review comments on your pull request.

## What

`platisd/clang-tidy-pr-comments` is a GitHub Action that utilizes the *exported fixes* of
`clang-tidy` for your C++ project and posts them as **code review comments** in the related **pull request**.

If `clang-tidy` has a concrete recommendation on how you should modify your code to fix the issue that's detected,
then it will be presented as a *suggested change* that can be committed directly. Alternatively,
the offending line will be highlighted along with a description of the warning.

The GitHub Action can be configured to *request changes* if `clang-tidy` warnings are found or merely
leave a comment without blocking the pull request from being merged. It should fail only if it has been
misconfigured by you, due to a bug (please contact me if that's the case) or the GitHub API acting up.

Please note the following:

* It will **not** run `clang-tidy` for you. You are responsible for doing that and then supply the Action with
  the path to your generated report (see [examples](#how) below). You can generate a
  YAML report that includes *fixes* for a pull request using the following methods:

  * Using the `run-clang-tidy` utility script with the `-export-fixes` argument. This script usually
    comes with the `clang-tidy` packages. You can use it to run checks *for the entire codebase* of a
    project at once.

  * Using the `clang-tidy-diff` utility script with the `-export-fixes` argument. This script also usually
    comes with the `clang-tidy` packages, and and it can be used to run checks only for code fragments that
    *have been changed* in a specific pull request.

  * Alternatively, you may use `--export-fixes` with `clang-tidy` itself in your own script.

  In any case, specify the path where you would like the report to be exported. The very same path should
  be supplied to this Action.

* It will *only* comment on files and lines changed in the pull request. This is due to GitHub not allowing
  comments on other files outside the pull request `diff`.
  This means that there may be more warnings in your project. Make sure you fix them *before* starting to
  use this Action to ensure new warnings will not be introduced in the future.

* This Action *respects* existing comments and doesn't repeat the same warnings for the same line (no spam).

* This Action allows analysis to be performed *separately* from the posting of the analysis results (using
  separate workflows with different privileges), which
  [allows you to safely analyze pull requests from forks](https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-preventing-pwn-requests/)
  (see [example](#using-this-action-to-safely-perform-analysis-of-pull-requests-from-forks) below).

### Supported clang-tidy versions

YAML files containing generated fixes by the following `clang-tidy` versions are currently supported:
* `clang-tidy-8`
* `clang-tidy-9`
* `clang-tidy-10`
* `clang-tidy-11`
* `clang-tidy-12`

## How

Since this action comments on files changed in pull requests, naturally, it can be only run
on `pull_request` events. That being said, if it happens to be triggered in a different context,
e.g. a `push` event, it will **not** run and fail *softly* by returning a *success* code.

### Basic configuration example

A basic configuration for the `platisd/clang-tidy-pr-comments` action (for a `CMake`-based project
using the `clang-tidy-diff` script) can be seen below:

```yaml
name: Static analysis

on: pull_request

jobs:
  clang-tidy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-20.04
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      with:
        fetch-depth: 2
    - name: Install clang-tidy
      run: |
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install -y clang-tidy
    - name: Prepare compile_commands.json
      run: |
        cmake -B build -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON
    - name: Create results directory
      run: |
        mkdir clang-tidy-result
    - name: Analyze
      run: |
        git diff -U0 HEAD^ | clang-tidy-diff -p1 -path build -export-fixes clang-tidy-result/fixes.yml
    - name: Run clang-tidy-pr-comments action
      uses: platisd/clang-tidy-pr-comments@master
      with:
        # The GitHub token (or a personal access token)
        github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        # The path to the clang-tidy fixes generated previously
        clang_tidy_fixes: clang-tidy-result/fixes.yml
        # Optionally set to true if you want the Action to request
        # changes in case warnings are found
        request_changes: true
        # Optionally set the number of comments per review
        # to avoid GitHub API timeouts for heavily loaded
        # pull requests
        suggestions_per_comment: 10
```

### Triggering this Action manually

If you want to trigger this Action manually, i.e. by leaving a comment with a particular *keyword*
in the pull request, then you can try the following:

```yaml
name: Static analysis

# Don't trigger it on pull_request events but issue_comment instead
on: issue_comment

jobs:
  clang-tidy:
    # Trigger the job only when someone comments: run_clang_tidy
    if: ${{ github.event.issue.pull_request && contains(github.event.comment.body, 'run_clang_tidy') }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-20.04
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      with:
        fetch-depth: 2
    - name: Install clang-tidy
      run: |
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install -y clang-tidy
    - name: Prepare compile_commands.json
      run: |
        cmake -B build -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON
    - name: Create results directory
      run: |
        mkdir clang-tidy-result
    - name: Analyze
      run: |
        git diff -U0 HEAD^ | clang-tidy-diff -p1 -path build -export-fixes clang-tidy-result/fixes.yml
    - name: Run clang-tidy-pr-comments action
      uses: platisd/clang-tidy-pr-comments@master
      with:
        github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        clang_tidy_fixes: clang-tidy-result/fixes.yml
```

### Using this Action to safely perform analysis of pull requests from forks

If you want to trigger this Action using the `workflow_run` event to run analysis on pull requests
from forks in a
[secure manner](https://securitylab.github.com/research/github-actions-preventing-pwn-requests/),
then you can use the following combination of workflows:

```yaml
# Insecure workflow with limited permissions that should provide analysis results through an artifact
name: Static analysis

on: pull_request

jobs:
  clang-tidy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-20.04
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      with:
        fetch-depth: 2
    - name: Install clang-tidy
      run: |
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install -y clang-tidy
    - name: Prepare compile_commands.json
      run: |
        cmake -B build -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON
    - name: Create results directory
      run: |
        mkdir clang-tidy-result
    - name: Analyze
      run: |
        git diff -U0 HEAD^ | clang-tidy-diff -p1 -path build -export-fixes clang-tidy-result/fixes.yml
    - name: Save PR metadata
      run: |
        echo ${{ github.event.number }} > clang-tidy-result/pr-id.txt
        echo ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name }} > clang-tidy-result/pr-head-repo.txt
        echo ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.ref }} > clang-tidy-result/pr-head-ref.txt
    - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
      with:
        name: clang-tidy-result
        path: clang-tidy-result/
```
